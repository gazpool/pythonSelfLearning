password manager based on this vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE&t=12s

DO NOT USE FOR REAL PASSWORDS!!!! Not secure, just an example of some py functions

Running will allow you to add passwords in an encrypted format to a text file and then read them unencrypted format

master pass is MasterPassword123. Failure to input that at the start will quit the program

master pass is not used as part of the key currently. The tutorial vid hinted at this but then backtracked as it required more complicated functions
